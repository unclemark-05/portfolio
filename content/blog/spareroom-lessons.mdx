# SpareRoom Nigeria: Lessons from Building a Rental Marketplace

Finding a room in Lagos can be a nightmare. Scams are rampant, trust is low, and the process is opaque. SpareRoom Nigeria was built to change that.

## The Challenge

The Lagos rental market has specific problems:

- **Fraud** — Fake listings and scam agents
- **No verification** — No way to verify landlords or tenants
- **Payment risks** — Money exchanged with no protection
- **Limited options** — Most listings are word-of-mouth

## The Solution

SpareRoom Nigeria tackles each problem with technology:

### BVN Verification

Every user must verify their identity with their Bank Verification Number (BVN). This creates accountability and reduces fraud significantly.

### Paystack Escrow

Money is held in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction. This protects both tenants and landlords.

### Verified Listings

All rooms go through a verification process before going live. Photos, location, and pricing are verified for accuracy.

## Technical Architecture

### Payment Integration

Integrating Paystack for escrow payments required careful handling:

- Split payments for platform fees
- Refund workflows for disputes
- Transaction logging for compliance

### Performance at Scale

With 500+ rooms across 19+ neighborhoods:

- Server-side filtering and pagination
- Image optimization for listing photos
- Cached search results for common queries

## Results

- **500+** verified rooms listed
- **19+** neighborhoods covered
- **Zero** fraud cases with BVN verification

## Key Lessons

1. **Trust is the product** — In a market plagued by scams, trust features matter more than flashy UI.
2. **Local payment solutions** — Paystack was the right choice for the Nigerian market.
3. **Start with one city** — Focusing on Lagos allowed us to build density before expanding.
