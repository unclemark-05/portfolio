# Building Opiro: A Direct-to-Fan Music Platform

The music industry has long had a problem: artists get a tiny fraction of streaming revenue. Opiro was born from the idea that artists deserve more.

## The Problem

Traditional streaming platforms pay artists fractions of a penny per stream. For independent artists, this model simply doesn't work. They need a platform that puts them first.

## The Solution

Opiro is a direct-to-fan platform where artists keep **85% of revenue**. Fans can discover new music, support artists directly, and build personal libraries.

### Key Technical Decisions

**Next.js for the Frontend**

I chose Next.js for its server-side rendering capabilities and excellent developer experience. The App Router made it easy to structure the application with:

- Server components for data-heavy pages
- Client components for interactive music players
- API routes for backend logic

**Supabase for the Backend**

Supabase provided everything I needed:

- PostgreSQL database for artist and track data
- Authentication for artist and fan accounts
- Storage for audio files and album artwork
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

**TanStack Query for Data Fetching**

With TanStack Query, I implemented:

- Optimistic updates for likes and follows
- Infinite scroll for music discovery
- Background refetching for real-time data

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the data model** — Getting the database schema right early saves countless hours.
2. **PWA matters for music** — Users expect to access their library offline.
3. **Audio is complex** — Handling audio playback across browsers requires careful attention.

## What's Next

Opiro continues to grow. Upcoming features include artist analytics, collaborative playlists, and a mobile app.
